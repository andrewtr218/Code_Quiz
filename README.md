# Code_Quiz
This a coding quiz which keeps track of the users name and score and, starts the quiz when prompted. A timer at the start of the quiz. An incorrect answer incurs a 5 second time loss penalty on top of a minus one score loss. Negative scores are not possible and so missing a question while at 0 points incurs no penalty. The quiz ends when time runs out or all the questions have been answered. After the quiz ends the user is taken to a record of all the high scores.
